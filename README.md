# moonGen
Classifying difficulty of climbing routes on the MoonBoard apparatus using novel machine learning / deep learning techniques

## Current Status
Completely finished:
* Scraping
* Baseline PyTorch framework: Dense (Fully-Connected), GCN

Partially finished:
* Baseline statistical learning models
* Evaluation metrics

## Action Plan
### Low-Effort
* Adding in orientation features
* Battery of statistical learning models

### Medium-Effort
* Re-defining PMI calculation in hold-hold adjacency relationship

### High-Effort
* Convolutional neural network as another baseline (work off of problem-hold matrix)
* Autoencoder for hold embedding extraction
